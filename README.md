## Description
The io-extra library provides a few extra IO methods that you may find
handy. They are `IO.closefrom`, `IO.fdwalk`, `IO.pread`, `IO.pread_ptr`,
`IO.pwrite`, `IO.writev`, `IO#directio?` and `IO#directio=`.
	
This library is not supported on MS Windows.

Support for OS X is limited. See below for details.

## Installation
`gem install io-extra`

## Adding the trusted cert
`gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djberg96/io-extra/main/certs/djberg96_pub.pem)`

## Synopsis
```ruby
require 'io-extra' # Do not use 'io/extra'

# Close all file descriptors from 3 up.
IO.closefrom(3)

# Inspect all the open handles
IO.fdwalk(0){ |handle|
  puts "=" * 40 
  p handle
  p handle.fileno
}

# Write an array to an IO object efficiently
IO.writev(fh.fileno, %w[a b c])
```

## Developer's Notes
The "require 'io-extra'" is preferred over 'io/extra' because this is a mix
of pure Ruby and C extension. The former require's the latter, so that way
you get all the methods and constants that you expect.

You might be wondering what the difference is between my implementation of
`IO.closefrom` and a pure Ruby version that looks something like this:

```ruby
def IO.closefrom(n)
  0.upto(n) do |fd|
    IO.for_fd(fd).close
  end
end
```

The primary difference is that this walks all file descriptors, rather
than only open file descriptors. However, I should note that this only
applies if your platform supports the `closefrom()` function. In that case,
the only advantage is speed.

You might also be wondering what the difference is between my implementation
of IO.fdwalk and a pure Ruby version that looks something like this:

```ruby
def IO.fdwalk(n)
  ObjectSpace.each_object(File){ |f|
    yield f if f.fileno >= n
  }
end
```

The primary difference is that this only closes Ruby file objects, not
necessarily every file handle opened by the Ruby process. For example,
handles opened via `system()` calls.

## Note to OS X Users
The OS X platform does not support `closefrom()` or `fdwalk()`. The hand-
crafted `IO.closefrom` function will not work because the `getrlimit()`
function on OS X does not work. Patches welcome.

## Update regarding pread and pwrite
As of Ruby 2.5, the `IO#pread` and `IO#pwrite` instance methods have been
baked into the language. Consequently, the singleton methods that this
library originally provided are now just wrappers around those instance
methods.

## Documentation
For further documentation, see the io_extra.txt file or the inline
documentation that was generated by RDoc (if you did a gem install).

## Known Issues
The `IO.writev` tests fail on Solaris. Short test scripts seem to work,
however. We're not sure what the issue is yet. Help wanted.

Update: As of 2018 Solaris is basically dead, so I'm not going to worry
about supporting Solaris unless there's an outcry.

well as the code for the IO.writev method.
