= Description
The io-extra library provides a few extra IO methods that you may find
handy. They are IO.closefrom, IO.fdwalk, IO#directio? and IO#directio=.
	
Not supported on MS Windows.

Limited support for OS X.

= Developer's Notes
You might be wondering what the difference is between my implementation of
IO.closefrom and a pure Ruby version that looks something like this:

   def IO.closefrom(n)
      0.upto(n) do |fd|
         IO.for_fd(fd).close
      end
   end

The primary difference is that this walks all file descriptors, rather
than only open file descriptors. However, I should note that this only
applies if your platform supports the closefrom() function. In that case,
the only advantage is speed.

You might also be wondering what the difference is between my implementation
of IO.fdwalk and a pure Ruby version that looks something like this:

   def IO.fdwalk(n)
      ObjectSpace.each_object(File){ |f|
         yield f if f.fileno >= n
      }
   end

The primary difference is that this only closes Ruby file objects, not
necessarily every file handle opened by the Ruby process. For example, handles
opened via system() calls.

= Note to OS X Users
The OS X platform does not support closefrom(), fdwalk() or directio(). The
hand-crafted IO.closefrom function will not work because the getrlimit()
function on OS X does not work. Patches welcome.

= Documentation
For further documentation, see the io_extra.txt file or the inline
documentation that was generated by RDoc (if you did a gem install).

= Known Issues
None that I'm aware of (beyond those documented above). Please file any bug
reports on the project page at http://www.rubyforge.org/projects/shards.

= Future Plans
* I may add the File::O_DIRECT open constant on platforms that support it.
* Switch from C extension to FFI.
