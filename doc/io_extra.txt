= Description
   The io-extra library provides a few extra IO methods that you may find
   handy.
	
= Supported Platforms
   Works on most Unix platforms.

   Not supported on MS Windows or OS X.

= Synopsis
   require "io/extra"
   
   # Print the fileno of each file handle and then close it
   IO.fdwalk(0){ |fh|
      p fh.fileno
      fh.close
   }
   
   # Close all file handles with a fileno greater than or equal to 2.
   IO.closefrom(2)
   
= Class Methods
IO.closefrom(low_fd)
   Closes all open file descriptors greater than or equal to 'low_fd'.
   
   This uses your systems native closefrom() function, if supported. If not,
   this method uses a slightly less efficient manual approach that uses
   getrlimit() behind the scenes.
   
IO.fdwalk(low_fd){ |fh| ... }
   Iterates over each open file descriptor and yields back a File object.
   Note that it is up to you to close file handles, if desired, when this
   method is used.
	
   Not supported on all platforms.

IO.pread(fd, length, offset)
   Reads +length+ bytes of data from the given +fd+, starting at +offset.
   The primary advantage of this method over Ruby's IO#read method is that
   it performs the read without changing the file pointer.

   Not supported on all platforms.

IO.pwrite(fd, buf, offset)
   Writes +buf+ to the given +fd+, starting at +offset. The primary advantage
   of this method over a standard seek & write approach is that it performs
   the write without changing the file pointer.

   Not supported on all platforms.

= Instance methods
IO#directio?
   Returns true or false, based on whether directio has been set for the
   current handle. The default is false.
   
   Note supported on all platforms.
   
IO#directio=(io_const)
   Sets the advice for the current file descriptor using directio().  Valid
   values are IO::DIRECTIO_ON and IO::DIRECTIO_OFF.
   
   All file descriptors start at DIRECTIO_OFF, unless your filesystem has
   been mounted using 'forcedirectio' (and supports that option).
   
   Not supported on all platforms
   
= Constants
IO::DIRECTIO_ON
   This value can be passed to IO#directio= in order to turn directio on for
   the given file handle.
   
   This value is only defined if your platform supports the directio()
   function.
IO::DIRECTIO_OFF
   This value can be passed to IO#directio= in order to turn directio off for
   the given file handle.
   
   This value is only defined if your platform supports the directio()
   function.
   
IO::EXTRA_VERSION
   Returns the current version number of this library as a String.
